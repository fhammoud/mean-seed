# MEAN Seed

This is a project to help you quickstart a MEAN, or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/)(Angular4) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) application.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0 and [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) version 4.15.0.

## Install

Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

## Start build watch

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `server/public/` directory and it will automatically rebuild when Angular code changes are detected. Just refresh your browser.

## Start Express server

Run `npm start` to start the Express server via [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/). Must build the project first to create the `server/public/` directory Express serves. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The server will automatically restart when Node code changes are detected.
